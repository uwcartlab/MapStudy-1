Park Street </br> Madison, WI 53706 </br> Phone: 608-262-1453; Email: reroth@wisc.edu </br></br> <strong>Description of Research:</strong></br> You are invited to participate in a study aimed at improving the design of interactive maps on the web. Specifically, the study investigates how we should design online maps that depict statistical information. </br></br> <strong>What will my participation involve?</strong> </br>If you decide to participate in this research, you will complete a survey that requires you to answer a series of tasks using different map designs. The survey will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. You will be compensated $10  for your participation upon completing the survey. </br></br> <strong>Are there any risks to me?</strong></br>Risk to participation is minimal. Thus, there are no foreseeable physical or mental risks to participation beyond those encountered in the normal course of everyday life.</br></br><strong>Are there any benefits to me?</strong></br>Your responses to the survey will be used to develop a better understanding of the design of interactive and online maps.</br></br><strong>How will my confidentiality be protected?</strong></br>No personally identifiable or sensitive information will be collected or maintained. Only group characteristics will be reported in publications of research findings.</br></br><strong>Whom should I contact if I have questions?</strong></br>You may ask any questions about the research at any time. If you have questions about the research after you leave today you should contact Robert E. Roth, PhD (PI) at 608-262-1453. If you are not satisfied with the response of the research team, have more questions, or want to talk with someone about your rights as a research participant, you should contact the University of Wisconsin-Madison Education Research and Social & Behavioral Science IRB Office at 608-263-2320. Your participation is completely voluntary and you can withdraw from the study at any time without compensation.</br></br><strong>If you agree to take part in this research study as outlined above, please click 'Next' below.

							"ask": "<strong>Thank you for agreeing to participate!</strong></br></br>Maps and geographic information are extremely common in daily life today! You may be familiar with mapping services like Apple Maps, Google Maps, and MapQuest. You also may make use of web maps in social media like Facebook, Foursquare, Instagram, and Twitter. Further, you might have explored more complex interactive maps in popular news outlets like the New York Times and the Washington Post. The purpose of this study is to learn how we should design these maps.</br></br><strong>Instructions</strong></br></br>In the following survey, you will be shown four different web map designs that depict the volume of tweets in Kansas in the last year. <strong><i>Twitter</i></strong> is a social media platform allowing users to submit 140 character tweets that include a mappable location. The volume of tweets often is used as a proxy for public interest and engagement around different topics (e.g., entertainment, fashion, food, sports), with the topics organized by 'hashtags' (using the pound '#' sign) to allow users to identify their comments by these topics. The density of tweets often follows the density of people, but for the following maps do <strong><u>not</u></strong> consider the relationship between tweets and population, as this is not relevant to the study.</br></br>The tweet topic will change from map to map, such that each tweet map pattern you will see is unique. You then will be asked a series of questions requiring you to {interact with and} interpret the map pattern to find the answer. Following each map task, you will be asked to assess the confidence you have in your answer and the difficulty you had in finding the answer. The map task <strong><u>is</u></strong> timed, so please do not divert your attention when completing the map tasks; the confidence and difficulty questions are <strong><u>not</u></strong> timed, so take your time in answering these follow-up questions.</br></br>Before viewing the maps, you will have the chance to test a sample map to get a feel for the web map functionality and map questions. After viewing the maps, you will be asked to answer a series of background and preference questions. You will be compensated after completing the map reading tasks and exit survey questions.</br></br><strong>Eligibility</strong></br></br>Before beginning, please once again review your eligibility for participating in the study: These restrictions greatly impact your responses.</br></br><ul><li>You must be 18 years of age or older.</li><li>You must be fluent in English.</li><li>You must currently be living in the United States, but not in Kansas due to familiarity with the tested Geography.</li><li>You do not have color vision impairment (i.e., are colorblind).</li><li>You must complete the survey on a non-mobile device, such as a laptop or desktop computer with a screen display of at least 10 inches. Completing the experiment on a smartphone or small screen tablet will greatly impact your performance and skew results.</li></ul></br></br><strong>Select 'Next' to confirm that you have read the instructions and confirm that you are eligible and ready to try the sample map.</strong>"
